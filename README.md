# KiCad-Libs

This is a collection of repos required for a KiCad installation, this includes the personal forks of symbols, footprints and 3D models where I add my additional components and also links to the standard footprints and 3D models generator's repos.

## Usage

Clone with `git clone git@github.com:navan93/KiCad-Libs.git --recurse-submodules`.

After clone, set these as the global libraries in KiCad by setting the values of the environment variables `KICAD7_SYMBOL_DIR`, `KICAD7_FOOTPRINT_DIR` and `KICAD7_3DMODEL_DIR` in **KiCad**-->**Preferences**-->**Configure Paths..**.
